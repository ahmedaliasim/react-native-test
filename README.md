# React Native Hiring Test

The goal is to check your react native skills, code structure, quality and attention to detail. Please make sure to check the general notes at the end.

## Task

Pick any subreddit you like. For instance you could pick https://www.reddit.com/r/aww.json. Setup a basic react native app that allows the user to interact with the subreddit as outlined in the user flow below:

## Userflow

### Login View

- User opens the app and is presented with a login form
- User can log in with an arbitrary username (for sake of simplicity) and the password "password"
- If credentials are correct, redirect to the second view or else show error message.

### Reditt Overview

- User sees a view with reddit's logo on top and the username displayed.
- Underneath will be a list of the pictures.
- The user can approve/disapprove the individual images by swiping either left or right like tinder. (https://tenor.com/view/timber-server-glue-summer-hunt-wood-swipe-left-gif-17235406)

### Users approve/disapprove list

- Users can switch to this view (and back to the previous view). You can make a navbar or a menu.
- User will see a list of puppy pictures with an indicator showing accepted or rejected.


## General Notes

- Style the components you'll use according to Reddit's UI (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en_US&gl=US)
- Don't reinvent the wheel: If you know a library that does what you need, use it. Good engineers are also good at stealing ;)
- If you use a react-native project template as boilerplate, please seperate this into an extra commit, so that we can see what you personally did.
- You don't have to create an app that runs both on iOS and Android. You can pick either one (although being cross-plattform will give you bonus points).

## Code Submit
Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production and send us a pull request. We will review it and get back to you in order to talk about your code! 

All the best and happy coding.
